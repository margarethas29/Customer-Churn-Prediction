# Customer-Churn-Prediction
## Study Case
Customer churn refers to the phenomenon where customers or subscribers stop doing business with a company or cancel their subscription to a service. It is a crucial metric for businesses, especially in industries with subscription-based models, as it directly impacts revenue and profitability. Understanding why customers churn and taking steps to reduce churn rates are important for maintaining a healthy customer base and sustainable business growth.
The telecommunications industry is experiencing rapid growth, driven by the ubiquitous use of the internet in today's society. Consumers, as customers, have the right to choose the best provider for their needs and can switch from their current provider. This phenomenon can potentially lead to a decrease in revenue for a company if customers switch providers. As a junior data scientist in a telecommunications company, I have been tasked with predicting customer churn.
